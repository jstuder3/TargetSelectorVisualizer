# Target Selection Visualizer

### This tool provides an intuitive visualization for a simple AI agent's probabilistic target priority. This could be used to have an AI enemy in a video game pick targets realistically.

### There's three parameters:

- CloseRangePriority: Prioritize targets that are close (>1) or far away (<1).

- SmallAnglePriority: Prioritize targets that are in front (>1) or behind (<1) the center.

- BlindSpotSize: Range of angles that are filtered out. 0: No filtering. 0.5: 180Â° filtering. 1: You are blind.
